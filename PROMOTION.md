# World Rank Promotion Kit

Here is the launch copy and strategy for promoting World Rank.

## 1. Reddit: r/InternetIsBeautiful & r/dataisbeautiful
*Focus on the data source and the "reality check" aspect. Avoid salesy language.*

**Title:** I built a privacy-first tool that accurately ranks your income against 8 billion people (using WID data)

**Body:**
> Hi Reddit,
>
> We often hear about the "Top 1%" or "Global Middle Class," but I realized most of us don't actually know where we stand globally.
>
> I built **World Rank** to answer that.
>
> **What it does:**
> 1.  **Income Rank:** You enter your annual income (USD), and it compares it against the World Inequality Database (WID 2024). It supports both PPP (Cost of Living) and Market Exchange Rates.
> 2.  **Lifestyle Quiz:** A Bayesian scoring quiz that estimates your global percentile based on assets, infrastructure, and connectivity.
>
> **Privacy First:**
> It runs entirely on-device (client-side). Your income data is **never** uploaded to any server.
>
> **Link:** [Insert Your Link Here]
>
> I'd love to hear your feedback on the data visualization!
